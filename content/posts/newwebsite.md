## I just recently completely remade this website using Hugo and the skyfall theme(slightly modified)

I had a bunch of weird issues regarding setting it properly up on Github Pages. One of them was related to the fact that it was pulling the theme directly from its own repo, which would cause some of my customizations to not work at all.
But I did, in fact get it to work exactly how I wanted it to.
